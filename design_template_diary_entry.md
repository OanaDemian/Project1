# Diary Entry Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

_Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have._

## 2. Design the Method Signature

_Include the name of the method, its parameters, return value, and side effects._

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return._

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
