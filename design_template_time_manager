# Time Manager Method Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

_Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have._

> As a user
> So that I can manage my time
> I want to see an estimate of reading time for a text, assuming that I can read 200 words a minute.


## 2. Design the Method Signature

_Include the name of the method, its parameters, return value, and side effects._

```ruby 
reading_time = time_manager(text)
# reading_time is time in minutes 
# text is a string
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return._

```ruby
# 1. 
time_manager("one")
# => 1 
#2.
time_manager(TWO_HUNDRED_WORDS)
# => 1 
# 3.
time_manager(THREE_HUNDRED_WORDS)
# => 2
# 4.
time_manager(FOUR_THOUSANDS_WORDS)
# => 20
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._


## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
